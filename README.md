# Flask Book Collection App

This program is a web application built using Flask and SQLAlchemy that manages a collection of books. Users can add new books, update the rating of existing books, and delete books from the collection. The data is stored in an SQLite database, and the app displays the book collection on the homepage.

## Features:
- **Add a Book**: Users can add a new book with a title, author, and rating.
- **Edit a Book**: Users can update the rating of any book in the collection.
- **Delete a Book**: Users can remove books from the collection.
- **View All Books**: All books are listed on the homepage.
